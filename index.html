        <h2><span class="text-primary">The History</span> of Our Hotel</h2>
        <p>
          The Overlook Hotel in Stephen King's novel "The Shining" is a
          fictional hotel located in the Colorado Rockies. The hotel is
          described as having a dark and haunted history, with numerous tragic
          events taking place there over the years. The hotel's remote location
          and isolation contribute to its eerie atmosphere, and its many
          hallways, rooms, and secret passages make it a labyrinthine maze. In
          the novel, the hotel's supernatural powers drive the protagonist, Jack
          Torrance, to madness, leading him to try to kill his wife and young
          son. The novel was first published in 1977 and has become a classic of
          horror literature, inspiring numerous adaptations, including the
          famous film directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1980.
